We lean on core.async's\n      efficiency here.\n    * For WebSocket fallback we use long-polling rather than HTTP 1.1 streaming\n      (chunked transfer encoding). Http-kit _does_ support chunked transfer\n      encoding but a small minority of browsers &/or proxies do not. Instead of\n      implementing all 3 modes (WebSockets, streaming, long-polling) - it seemed\n      reasonable to focus on the two extremes (performance + compatibility).\n      In any case client support for WebSockets is growing rapidly so fallback\n      modes will become increasingly irrelevant while the extra simplicity will\n      continue to pay dividends.\n\n  General-use notes:\n    * Single HTTP req+session persists over entire chsk session but cannot\n      modify sessions! Use standard a/sync HTTP Ring req/resp for logins, etc.\n    * Easy to wrap standard HTTP Ring resps for transport over chsks. Prefer\n      this approach to modifying handlers (better portability).\n\n  [4] Used to be a csrf-token.
